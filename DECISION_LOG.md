# Decision Log

- **2026-06-04**: v7 repo is public.
- **2026-06-04**: no license file yet.
- **2026-06-04**: stable source baseline is Wakeboardsam/v6_IBKR_WebAPI tag v6.3.1-Single_Account_Stable.
- **2026-06-04**: Phase 1 model is independent bot instances, not a centralized multi-account supervisor.
- **2026-06-04**: initial later add-on folders are planned as ibkr_gateway and tqqq_bot.

## 2026-06-05 — Step 02 HA scaffold validation passed

Outcome:
- Home Assistant repository install succeeded.
- V7_ibkr_gateway installed and started.
- V7_tqqq_bot installed and started.
- Both add-ons stayed running safely.
- Gateway runtime/login did not start.
- Bot runtime/strategy did not start.
- Account ID masking worked: DU1****567.
- This is the stable checkpoint before Step 03 v6 runtime port.

Decision:
- Preserve this scaffold as the known-good HA install baseline.
- Step 03 will port the real v6 tqqq_bot runtime into V7_tqqq_bot.
- Do not duplicate tqqq_bot for other accounts until the first runtime port works.
