# Decision Log

- **2026-06-04**: v7 repo is public.
- **2026-06-04**: no license file yet.
- **2026-06-04**: stable source baseline is Wakeboardsam/v6_IBKR_WebAPI tag v6.3.1-Single_Account_Stable.
- **2026-06-04**: Phase 1 model is independent bot instances, not a centralized multi-account supervisor.
- **2026-06-04**: initial later add-on folders are planned as ibkr_gateway and tqqq_bot.

## 2026-06-05 — Step 02 HA scaffold validation passed

Outcome:
- Home Assistant repository install succeeded.
- V7_ibkr_gateway installed and started.
- V7_tqqq_bot installed and started.
- Both add-ons stayed running safely.
- Gateway runtime/login did not start.
- Bot runtime/strategy did not start.
- Account ID masking worked: DU1****567.
- This is the stable checkpoint before Step 03 v6 runtime port.

Decision:
- Preserve this scaffold as the known-good HA install baseline.
- Step 03 will port the real v6 tqqq_bot runtime into V7_tqqq_bot.
- Do not duplicate tqqq_bot for other accounts until the first runtime port works.

## 2026-06-08 — Step 03/PR 05 v6 runtime ported into tqqq_bot

Outcome:
- Ported the v6 TQQQ python bot runtime from `v6_baseline/v6_IBKR_WebAPI` into `tqqq_bot`.
- Verified account scoping logic correctly limits execution to `ibkr_account_id`.
- TQQQ Bot connect outward to `ibkr_gateway`.
- Strategy components (Grid logic, Sheets, Bridge Anchor) remain unchanged.

Decision:
- `tqqq_bot` is configured to map `gateway_host` and `gateway_port` options directly into the python environment.
- Tests will live outside of the production Docker environment (`tqqq_bot/tests`).
- Gateway and IBC processes were completely separated from the bot to ensure true micro-service boundaries.
